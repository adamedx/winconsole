# Welcome to this time capsule!
Welcome! This repository contains source from an old personal or academic project of Adam Edwards prior to the age of Github that is now being published for the first time. It is available via a standard open source license.

## Disclaimers
The primary purpose of sharing this code is offsite backup, along with the convenience for me of being able to immediately use `git` in the unlikely case I ever dust off this project to improve it. Given this and the code's original limited audience, the following disclaimers apply:

* I may have developed this project in college, so any or all aspects of code quality may reflect pre-professional experience on my part
* If I didn't write it in college, I most likely sneaked in some time to develop it off to the side of my professional engineering career. With that time constraint and the primary goal being that of completing a learning exercise or just satisfying curiousity or the need for a diversion, quality limitations will apply. :)
* If this was not an academic project, it has little or no documentation because of its undertaking primarily as a diversion.
* The project was started and finished long before my involvement in open source, so its currently not very friendly to collaboration. 
* There is a good chance that the build system for this project is obsolete or makes assumptions about an IDE that make it difficult to build
* This project is being published as it was when last modified, many years ago. I *may* improve the quality of the project some day, but right now I'd simply like a reliable archive, so as long as this disclaimer exists, you'll know I still haven't gotten around to it.
